## üß† Location Inference Rules

- If the event `summary` or `title` mentions ‚ÄúCampbelltown‚Äù or ‚ÄúSt Marys‚Äù, set that as the `location`.
- If no location is provided and no clue exists in the title, default to `null`.
- Use the clean string: `"Campbelltown"` or `"St Marys"` in the structured output.
