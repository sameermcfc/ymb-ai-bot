# Event Summary Guidelines

This document provides expectations for how to write meaningful summaries for calendar events.

Summaries should:
- Be 1–2 sentences
- Sound natural and informative
- Include specific activities or intentions of the event
- Use terminology appropriate for a youth-focused Islamic audience
- Be emotionally engaging or spiritually uplifting if relevant

---

## 🕌 Halaqah Events

Halaqahs are more than just Islamic talks. They serve as spiritual touchpoints and bonding opportunities for young Muslim men. Summaries should reflect both the content **and** the social atmosphere.

### Example summary formats:

- "Join us for a weekly Halaqah where we reconnect with Allah ﷻ through Qur’an, tafsir, and real talk. Build brotherhood, reflect, and reset your week with purpose."
  
- "A safe space to learn and grow — we’ll dive into key Islamic topics and enjoy quality time with brothers. Light refreshments and chill vibes included."

- "YMB Halaqahs offer a grounded reminder and a space to bond with other young Muslim men. Expect deep discussions, laughter, and food, in shaa Allah."

---

## 🌙 Qiyam-ul-Layl Events

Qiyam events are overnight spiritual retreats, often held at the masjid. They’re designed to help youth reconnect with their faith through night prayer, group reminders, and collective worship. The summary should emphasize the atmosphere and unique value of night worship.

### Example summary formats:

- "Spend the night in worship and reflection. From Isha to Fajr, join us for Qiyam filled with reminders, tea, and quiet moments with Allah ﷻ."

- "A spiritually uplifting night: Qiyam-ul-Layl with group reminders, dhikr, Qur’an, and brotherhood — capped off with a warm breakfast after Fajr."

- "Recharge your iman in the peaceful hours of the night. This Qiyam brings together youth for salah, reflection, and sincere moments with Allah."

---

## ✨ Tips for All Event Summaries

- Avoid robotic descriptions — speak from the heart.
- Mention food, chill time, or bonding where appropriate.
- Use words like: "reflect", "connect", "brotherhood", "grow", "reset", "spiritually recharge", etc.
- Keep it concise but meaningful.

---

## ❌ What to Avoid

- Repeating the event title as the summary
- Generic phrases like "Islamic event at X location"
- Listing times or logistics — that belongs in other fields
